        My name is Rodolphe, and I'm a student in high-performance computing and simulation at the Universit√© Paris-Saclay in Paris. I played competitive volleyball in high school.
        I spend most of my time working on personal projects. I'm also interested in Linux and free software. I enjoy code optimization and low-level programming. 
        Apart from that, I'm a biker who likes to cook and hike.
